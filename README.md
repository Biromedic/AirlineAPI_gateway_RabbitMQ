## üìä System Architecture

This application follows a modular **microservice architecture**:

1. **Airline API**:
   - Manages core features like flights, tickets, and bookings.
   - Role-based access control for administrators and users.

2. **Messaging Service**:
   - Handles communication between services via RabbitMQ.
   - Supports queue-based messaging for real-time notifications.

3. **Payment Service**:
   - Processes payments and integrates with notification services.
   - Payment confirmation triggers user notifications.

4. **Notification Service**:
   - Listens to RabbitMQ queues for messages.
   - Sends notifications after payment processing.

5. **API Gateway**:
   - Acts as a single entry point for all services.
   - Routes requests to appropriate microservices.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

-	JWT-based Authentication: Login returns a JWT token that must be included in the Authorization header as Bearer <token> for protected routes.
    
-	Role-based Access: ADMIN and USER roles control access to endpoints.
